This site is [hopefully] updated on a semi-regular basis by Joseph McLaughlin. Some topics I'd like to cover:

- Programming (especially Swift)
- Mechanical Keyboards
- Social psychology
- Tips for working from home
- Music
- Sports
- Apple

The title is a terribly constructed line of Swift code. Long live singletons?
