It's only fitting that the first post on this new site should be about yak shaving.

For those of you unfamiliar with the concept ([as defined by Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)):

> Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem.

This clip of Bryan Cranston's character Hal trying to replace a light bulb, but having to do a seemingly endless set of tasks before being able to, illustrates the concept nicely.

I've been doing some yak shaving of my own over the Christmas break in order to accomplish the seemingly simple task of publishing an article. Writing the article is easy enough, but then there's the question about where to publish, which domain name to use, the work of designing and coding a new blog theme, and yes, even styling the mp4 embed just so.

But here I am, with a "shaved yak" (a new domain name, a new blogging platform, and a spiffy new design [which I'm quite proud of]). Now I can finally start on the task of writing the [promised article](https://twitter.com/mclaughj/status/943192793027002368) about custom mechanical keyboards.

I've got a ton of other things I want to write about, so hopefully with the yak out of the way I can focus on the important stuff.
