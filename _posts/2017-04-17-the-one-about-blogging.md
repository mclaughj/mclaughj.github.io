title: The one about blogging...
---

For quite some time, I've had some ideas kicking around my head that I wanted to write down. I try to write daily journal entries, and those are great, but writing things publicly (whether or not they're read) seems to scratch a different itch. So as I wound down on a big release at work, and found myself having a few extra brain cycles in the evening, I decided to start up a blog (again). This blog will be a place where I can write about the things that interest me, and hopefully scratch that itch I've been feeling.

A lot of what takes up my free time isn't (always) reflected by my social media presence, which bothers me in some ways. I want to share some of the things that interest me and connect with like-minded people all over the world. Some of those interests include (in no particular order): golf, basketball, baseball, mechanical keyboards, vinyl records, social psychology, movies, and photography. On top of those, I'm constantly trying to stay up on new technology, especially as it relates to my career in software development. I hope to write about some (or all) of these topics, and I'd love to have you along for the ride.
